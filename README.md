# 🚀 Data Scientist Income T-Test Hypothesis Analysis

This project involves analyzing and testing hypotheses regarding data scientists' income using statistical methods, specifically t-tests. The dataset includes salary information from various companies, and we aim to provide actionable insights for freshers looking for job opportunities. 💼

## 📊 Project Overview

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹  
   - Cleaning salary columns (`Average`, `Lowest`, `Highest`).
   - Filtering data based on frequency `/yr`.
   - Removing outliers using the IQR method.

2. **Statistical Analysis** 🧮  
   - Calculation of population and sample statistics (mean, standard deviation).
   - Hypothesis testing:
     - Two-tailed t-test.
     - One-tailed t-tests (greater/less).

3. **Visualizations** 📈  
   - Normal distribution plots for population and sample salaries.
   - Scatter plots: Rating vs. Average Salary for population and sample.

4. **Company Suggestions** 🏢  
   - Suggesting companies based on user-specified expected salary.

5. **Conclusions and Practical Advice** 📝  
   - Insights derived from hypothesis testing.
   - Tips for freshers choosing companies based on salary and ratings.

## 💻 Prerequisites
